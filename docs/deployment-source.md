# Deployment source reconciliation — September 2026

The current public-site design and the September membership/business updates
were on `agent/ai-team-spain-address-search` at `93e1acaaaa6067d89df322c8de72854dffe2622f`.
`master` was still based on the older UI when sitemap commit `b39a7a5` and
PageSpeed commit `7a4865a` were published, so those automatic builds restored
the older site. `main` contains the CRM project, not the current public site.

The combined release starts from the current public-site source, retains both
SEO/performance patches, and adds the achievement manager. Conflict resolutions
retain discovery-redesign.css, analytics session cookies, the full modern test
suite, and the sitemap/auth-crawl rules. The production build now checks the
current discovery and venue-dashboard source contract before compilation.

Use `master` for subsequent public-site releases after this reconciliation.
Fetch it before editing. Do not publish a tree assembled from an older branch.
The release commit records both branch tips as parents. The CRM deployment
branch remains separate.

Before accepting a release, inspect `/es` and `/en` for CityDiscovery, check the
membership packages and venue dashboard, confirm the achievement route is
admin-only, and verify sitemap XML. A Cloudflare rollback changes live traffic;
it does not update GitHub source.
