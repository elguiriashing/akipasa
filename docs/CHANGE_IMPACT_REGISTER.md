### YYYY-MM-DD | PR # | Domain and owner

- User-visible change and exact expectation:
- Current code paths, routes, buttons/labels, EN/ES copy:
- Read/write data flow, DB tables/RPC, storage, external APIs, role/consent:
- Callers and downstream pages, other portals, Android, jobs, map/search/SEO/cache:
- Source-of-truth conflicts / earlier incidents checked:
- Files changed and why:
- Tests added/updated, exact commands and pass/fail/skip:
- Cross-role, cross-locale, theme, 360px/desktop coverage:
- Security/privacy, idempotency, migrations, rollback:
- Production build/deployment ID, URL smoke, metrics/logs (or NOT DEPLOYED):
- Outstanding gaps and accountable follow-up:

## 2026-10-09 | Initial contract baseline

- Reviewed: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/deployment-source.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md` plus accumulated user requests through 2026-10-09.
- Added `docs/AKIPASA_MASTER.md` as an initial **non-exhaustive** contract and agent playbook.
- No application code, database records, CI settings, production service or deployment touched.
- **Not run**: application/build/browser/production tests. Documentation-only change composed through GitHub connector; no local repository runtime available.
- Next required audit: programmatically traverse all `src/app` routes and `src/components` event handlers, labels, permissions and mutation flows and link each to specific code/tests. Inventory release branches, current DB policies and production observability with approved access.

## 2026-10-09 | PR #71 automation extension

- Added source scanner `scripts/generate-system-inventory.mjs` and PR contract guard `scripts/check-change-contract.mjs`; added `.github/workflows/master-system-contract.yml` to run both and upload the route inventory as an artifact.
- Static coverage: Next page/layout/route paths, UI tag/handler/label sites, integration keyword matches, migrations and tests. Dynamic runtime contracts, imports, all rendered text, DB policies and end-to-end click semantics are **not** exhaustively mapped by this heuristic.
- Verification: GitHub connector confirmed writes; no local source checkout or runnable CI environment. **Not run**: Node scripts, full source scan, unit/e2e tests or Actions build. Must inspect GitHub Actions result before claiming checks pass.
- No application runtime code, external services, paid campaign, secrets, database or deployment modified.
- Follow-up: make this workflow a required branch protection check; add richer AST-based interactive inventory and route-to-test mapping; run smoke/browser tests in a checked-out environment.
