### YYYY-MM-DD | PR # | Domain and owner

- User-visible change and exact expectation:
- Current code paths, routes, buttons/labels, EN/ES copy:
- Read/write data flow, DB tables/RPC, storage, external APIs, role/consent:
- Callers and downstream pages, other portals, Android, jobs, map/search/SEO/cache:
- Source-of-truth conflicts / earlier incidents checked:
- Files changed and why:
- Tests added/updated, exact commands and pass/fail/skip:
- Cross-role, cross-locale, theme, 360px/desktop coverage:
- Security/privacy, idempotency, migrations, rollback:
- Production build/deployment ID, URL smoke, metrics/logs (or NOT DEPLOYED):
- Outstanding gaps and accountable follow-up:

## 2026-10-09 | Initial contract baseline

- Reviewed: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/deployment-source.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md` plus accumulated user requests through 2026-10-09.
- Added `docs/AKIPASA_MASTER.md` as an initial **non-exhaustive** contract and agent playbook.
- No application code, database records, CI settings, production service or deployment touched.
- **Not run**: application/build/browser/production tests. Documentation-only change composed through GitHub connector; no local repository runtime available.
- Next required audit: programmatically traverse all `src/app` routes and `src/components` event handlers, labels, permissions and mutation flows and link each to specific code/tests. Inventory release branches, current DB policies and production observability with approved access.

## 2026-10-09 | PR #71 automation extension

- Added source scanner `scripts/generate-system-inventory.mjs` and PR contract guard `scripts/check-change-contract.mjs`; added `.github/workflows/master-system-contract.yml` to run both and upload the route inventory as an artifact.
- Static coverage: Next page/layout/route paths, UI tag/handler/label sites, integration keyword matches, migrations and tests. Dynamic runtime contracts, imports, all rendered text, DB policies and end-to-end click semantics are **not** exhaustively mapped by this heuristic.
- Verification: GitHub connector confirmed writes; no local source checkout or runnable CI environment. **Not run**: Node scripts, full source scan, unit/e2e tests or Actions build. Must inspect GitHub Actions result before claiming checks pass.
- No application runtime code, external services, paid campaign, secrets, database or deployment modified.
- Follow-up: make this workflow a required branch protection check; add richer AST-based interactive inventory and route-to-test mapping; run smoke/browser tests in a checked-out environment.

## 2026-10-09 | Advanced booking resources and recurrence (candidate PR)

- User-visible goal: resource pools, non-overlapping capacity, native
  recurring availability, SVG icons replacing emoji template visuals.
- Existing locations:
  `src/components/BookingManager.tsx`,
  `src/app/[locale]/business/venue/[id]/page.tsx`, and `actions.ts`.
- New DB migrations:
  `20261009115000_booking_resources.sql` and
  `20261009120000_recurring_booking_slots.sql`.
- Dependencies: venue slot RLS, owner/manager roles, `request_booking` RPC,
  public venue/event booking forms, time zone, native booking-mode settings.
- Integrity: resources belong to their venue; named resource capacity cannot
  be exceeded; only one active overlapping slot per resource; old records
  retain nullable resource assignment. The recurring RPC is permission-gated
  and bounded to 90 days.
- Regression coverage: new `tests/booking-manager.test.tsx` UI cases; SQL
  validation, full repository CI and live smoke status pending.
- Release state: NOT DEPLOYED. Existing schema and production booking data
  have not been changed by this feature branch.
- Remaining architecture: specialized stay inventory, dining/table joins,
  ticket tiers, payments and staff calendars need additional design/tests.

## 2026-10-09 | PR #74 extension: bookable offerings

- Business behavior: managers create independent named offerings with booking type, duration and capacity, then attach them to manual or recurring availability slots. Customers see offering names for eligible slots. Existing slots without offerings continue working.
- Paths: `src/components/BookingManager.tsx`, venue owner actions and loader, public venue booking page, `booking_offerings` migration, recurring RPC, SQL and UI test suites.
- Database: RLS and same-venue foreign key protect bookings from cross-venue references; offering capacity checked on slot insert/update. Existing resource lock and request_bookings RPC preserved.
- Other surfaces: bilingual venue booking UI and business dashboard, public availability reads, migration ordering. No changes to AkiHQ, Google Ads, Stripe or live pricing.
- Evidence: tests and GitHub CI pending for this latest extension; no staging acceptance or live smoke claimed. No production deployment.
- Remaining: managed cancellations, resource availability exceptions, full ticket/inventory/room-night models, authenticated browser tests and accessible UI review.
